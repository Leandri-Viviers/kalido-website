<h1><a id="top"></a>Copyright Distribution</h1>
<h2>Effective date: 1 September 2015</h2>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t really have to be said, but stealing is not ok. As a community based on trust, respect, and meaningful human relationships, we want all our users to be able to showcase their creativity and talent without worrying that their stuff is going to be ripped off. To this end, we&rsquo;ve drafted this Copyright Distribution Policy (we&rsquo;ll call it the &lsquo;Copyright Policy&rsquo; from now) which governs copyright infringement and alleged infringements on Kalido. This Copyright Policy forms part of our <a href="http://www.kalido.me/terms_of_use/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<h2>I think someone is illegally using my stuff, what can I do?</h2>
<p>We take copyright infringement and plagiarism very seriously. If you believe your stuff has been used without your consent, please send a notice of copyright infringement to our Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our &lsquo;Designated Agent&rsquo;, whose details can be found below), including the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature, as the owner of the copyrighted material. If you are using an agent to deal with the issue on your behalf, then the agent&rsquo;s signature;</li>
<li>Details and location of the copyrighted material, so we can find and identify it;</li>
<li>Details of the material infringing on the copyright. Please give us enough information so that we can track down the material, and verify its existence;</li>
<li>Your contact details including address, telephone number, and email;</li>
<li>A statement by you stating that you believe in good faith that your material has been used without your consent, and in violation of the law;</li>
<li>A statement by you under penalty of perjury that all the info you&rsquo;ve provided us is accurate, and that you are authorized to make the complaint of copyright infringement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What happens after I&rsquo;ve submitted my notice of copyright infringement?</h2>
<p>Once our Designated Agent has received your notice, with all the relevant info included, we reserve the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>
<li>Notify the content provider of the infringing material that we&rsquo;ve removed or disabled the material;</li>
<li>Terminate the content provider&rsquo;s access to Kalido if they are a repeat offender.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Someone is accusing me of infringing their copyright, but I haven&rsquo;t. What can I do?</h2>
<p>If you believe that you have the right to use material that we&rsquo;ve removed or disabled for copyright infringement, you can send our Designated Agent (whose details can be found below) a counter-notice, including the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature as the content provider;</li>
<li>Details and location of the material we&rsquo;ve removed or disabled, so we can find and identify it;</li>
<li>A statement by you stating that you believe in good faith that your material does not infringe any copyright laws, and that you have the right to use it;</li>
<li>Your contact details including address, telephone number, and email;</li>
<li>A statement by you consenting to the jurisdiction of any area Kalido is operating in, and that you will accept service of process from the person who notified us of a possible copyright infringement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once our Designated Agent has received your counter-notice, including all relevant information, we may at our discretion send the notifying party your counter-notice, informing them that we may be replacing your material, or ceasing to disable it, in 10 business days. We will then replace or restore access to your material, at our discretion, unless the notifying party files an action seeking a court order to prevent us from doing so.</p>
