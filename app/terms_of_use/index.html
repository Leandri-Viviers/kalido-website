<h1><a id="top"></a>Kalido Terms of Use</h1>
<h2>Effective date: 25 May 2018</h2>
<p>Kalido was built with one person in mind: you. We&rsquo;re here to help you make meaningful, mutually beneficial work and social relationships. So, to ensure we deliver the best service to you, please review these Terms of Use (we&rsquo;ll call them the &lsquo;Terms&rsquo; from here on). As a Kalido user, you agree to be bound by the Terms and our <a href="http://www.kalido.me/copyright_distribution/">Copyright Distribution Policy</a> (which we encourage you to read too). We also require you to read and accept our <a href="http://www.kalido.me/privacy_policy/">Privacy Policy</a> and our Cookie Policy, If you have any questions, or concerns, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a> and one of our friendly team will get back to you as soon as possible. Please also take advantage of the measures that Kalido offers you to personalise your privacy settings.</p>
<h2>Terms and conditions applicable to all Kalido users</h2>
<p>i. To register on Kalido, you&rsquo;ll have to accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy and our Community Guidelines. All these documents constitute legal contracts, so you need to be a legal person with the capacity to enter into agreements. If you&rsquo;re a minor, you&rsquo;ll need your legal guardian to agree on your behalf. If you&rsquo;re acting on behalf of a company, you need to be legally entitled to do so. Please note that we do not accept users under the age of 16 under any circumstances.</p>
<p>ii. Kalido helps you build professional and personal relationships. In order to make these genuine and meaningful, you should provide as much detail about yourself as you&rsquo;re comfortable sharing. Don&rsquo;t use a fake name, give false credentials, or pass someone else&rsquo;s work off as your own. After all, Kalido is about showcasing <em>you</em>. To ensure you know what we do with your data, you can find our Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.kalido.me/privacy_policy/">here</a>. Remember, you&rsquo;ll need to accept the Privacy Policy separately, and to give your approval for us to use the data you provide, so that Kalido is as useful as it can be to you.</p>
<p>iii. We&rsquo;re all law-abiding citizens here, so you agree not to use Kalido to break any laws, or act in a generally unpleasant way. &lsquo;Unlawfulness&rsquo; and &lsquo;unpleasantness&rsquo; include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breach or infringement of copyright, contract, intellectual property, and all other applicable local and international laws;</li>
<li>Behaviour that jeopardizes your, or any other user&rsquo;s, or Kalido&rsquo;s safety. For example, you shouldn&rsquo;t allow anyone else to log in to your personal profile (this could harm you). You also shouldn&rsquo;t use anyone else&rsquo;s work without their permission (this harms them). Nor should you post hateful or offensive content (this harms us and other Kalido users);</li>
<li>Harassment, intimidation, fraudulent or obscene behaviour;</li>
<li>Modifying the Kalido app;</li>
<li>Accessing the Kalido servers, communications, or data using anything other than an unmodified Kalido app;</li>
<li>Activity designed primarily to overload Kalido&rsquo;s servers, or otherwise negatively affect other Kalido users&rsquo; experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;re very serious about keeping our community one based on respect, trust, and meaningful human connections. Therefore, if any user&rsquo;s behaviour violates or corrupts the spirit of our community, we reserve the right to remove this user with immediate effect.</p>
<p>iv. As with all other online forums, you should protect your account and personal information as much as you reasonably can. In return, we have implemented strict security measures to protect you and your information too. You can find out more about how we protect your information from our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>v. As a Kalido user, you&rsquo;ll be giving us and other users access to your personal information. If you need more information about this, please consult our Privacy Policy. In the same vein, you&rsquo;ll also be given access to others&rsquo; personal information. We expect all our users to be respectful of each other.</p>
<p>vi. We will store and share your personal information, but only in as far as it&rsquo;s necessary to help you make the most of Kalido. For example, we might allow other users to see your name and location, to help them decide whether you&rsquo;re a good match. Remember, you can tailor the audience of any information you share (specifically, by setting your default match settings to ensure that you only match with one of a) people you know, b) people in your personal network (i.e. only match with people you know and the people that they know), c) people in specific networks, and d) anyone. You also have the option to turn off Featured Providers in your in-app settings. You can also opt out of being selected as a Featured Provider by only offering services to particular people, not &lsquo;everyone&rsquo;. You can always change your preferences from your in-app settings. We will always respect your privacy and sharing preferences.</p>
<p>vii. By sharing content with us (this is called your &lsquo;user submissions&rsquo; in legal jargon), you are granting us a license over your content. And for further legal jargon, please note that this license is royalty-free, sub-licenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your account, we will stop displaying your content as per our Privacy Policy, and delete all your user content from our servers.</p>
<p>We will always respect the audience you&rsquo;ve chosen for your personal information. For example, you can choose to restrict who can see certain information on your profile - you are able to restrict who can see your goals, choosing to allow 1) only people in your networks to view them, 2) only people in specific networks that you belong to to view them, or 3) allowing anyone to view them. The licenses that you grant us mean we will only display, perform, or distribute your information to the respective audience you&rsquo;ve chosen. However, please note that if some of your content has been copied or stored by third parties e.g. if one of your matches took a screenshot of your profile, we don&rsquo;t have control over that. Remember, you can also control what information you allow us to collect.</p>
<p>viii. In order to properly showcase your content on Kalido, we might have to make changes to your user submissions occasionally e.g. by cropping your picture to fit within the profile frame. Please note that all your content is protected by all applicable local and international law.</p>
<p>ix. We&rsquo;re a platform that helps you connect with other human beings. As such, we offer services like letting you share pictures, chat directly to contacts, and ask mutual contacts for referrals and introductions. All this is designed to help you decide who the best person to work and hang out with is.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t vet or endorse any users, nor are we responsible for any user&rsquo;s content or claims. However, as stated above, we expect all our users to treat each other with respect, so if you encounter any fraudulent or unlawful behaviour, please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a>, and we&rsquo;ll deal with the offender immediately. We reserve the right to remove any user that violates the law, the Terms, our Privacy Policy, and/or our Community Guidelines. We also reserve the right to remove content (including content belonging to you), if it violates any of the above.</p>
<p>x. We provide you, our users, with a platform to interact with other users. However, we aren&rsquo;t responsible for your actual interactions. For example, we won&rsquo;t be able to help you enforce payment from someone, or draw up a contract. We encourage all our users to do their own checks, through the services we offer e.g. by asking mutual contacts for referrals. You agree that Kalido shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>
<p>xi. As we are simply a platform that provides you with a space to interact with others, in the event of a dispute, whether between you and another user, or between you and a third party, we&rsquo;re not under any legal obligation to get involved. However, as we want our users to have a positive experience, we&rsquo;ll probably endeavor to help you where we can.</p>
<p>xii. You agree to indemnify us, our officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and successors from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from any disputes between you and another user, or third party.</p>
<p>xiii. Please note that you&rsquo;ll be responsible for any tax, legal, or payment obligations that arise out of your use of Kalido e.g. you still have to pay income tax to the relevant authorities. We won&rsquo;t help you escape your legal obligations.</p>
<p>xiv. Kalido, its services and all its content, are offered to you on an &lsquo;as is&rsquo; basis, without being subject to any warranty.</p>
<p>xv. Kalido is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, private, personal, and non-commercial basis, subject to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and the law. This means you are our user, and are not affiliated with us, or represent us in any way.</p>
<p>xvi. While interacting with Kalido, you might come across third party content (for example, we might allow advertising partners to place content on our platform in the future). You might also jump to third party websites from Kalido. Please note that we are not responsible for the content, actions, omissions, or representations of third parties, but we will, as far as possible, adopt the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will limit the number of third party platforms that we work with;</li>
<li>We will limit the data that we share with any third party platforms, and make sure that you are informed about what data we are sharing, and who we are sharing it with (you can view our current third party partners by referring to our <a href="http://www.kalido.me/privacy_policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. If we add or remove any partners, we&rsquo;ll be sure to let you know).</li>
<li>We will make it easy for you to turn off the data we share with specific providers, if our providers have enabled us to do this. If we do not have this option, we will be sure to flag this to you, so that you can make an informed choice about how your data is shared.</li>
</ul>
<p>xvii. If either you or we fail to exercise in any way any right in these Terms, this shall not be deemed as a waiver of any further rights.</p>
<h2>Will Kalido ever change its services?</h2>
<p>Our basic service, helping you make great matches, will always remain. However, we&rsquo;re constantly improving our service, so we&rsquo;ll be introducing new features in the future. We&rsquo;ll always give our users notice of any changes to our service, either through our website, email, or SMS (if you&rsquo;ve opted in to being contacted by us). If we ever change our Privacy Policy, we&rsquo;ll give you notice through our website or via email (if you&rsquo;ve opted in to being contacted by us). We&rsquo;ll also let you know via in-app notifications.</p>
<h2>What fees does Kalido charge?</h2>
<p>Kalido&rsquo;s basic service is free, and always will be. This is because we believe in entrepreneurship and encourage meaningful connections, so we want as many professionals to be able to work on their own terms as possible, and as many clients to be able to find them as possible.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t charge commission, recruiting, or service fees. Payment between you and another user is thus entirely your responsibility.</p>
<h2>How does a user leave Kalido?</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re free to leave Kalido at any time. We&rsquo;ll be sorry to see you go, but we&rsquo;ll delete your personal info as requested. However, we might still retain de-identified info (in other words, information that can&rsquo;t be linked to you as an individual) in an anonymous, aggregated form to improve our service. In accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), you may request details of personal information which we hold about you. Although the GDPR provisions only apply to users in the European Union, we have extended the same protections to all of our users. You can review our Privacy Policy to understand what data we collect from you, why we collect this data, and how you can control what data we collect from you.</p>
<p>We may remove a user at our discretion, if in our opinion the user has violated the law, these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or Community Guidelines. If we do plan to remove a user, we&rsquo;ll try to let that user know, so they can retrieve the content they&rsquo;ve stored on their profile, unless this would be impractical, illegal, or harmful to someone else or to us.</p>
<p>Please note that any obligations that existed before a user leaves Kalido will continue to exist e.g. if you had to pay us fees, or if someone had to pay you. All parties will be expected to honour these obligations, regardless of a party leaving Kalido.</p>
<p>You may not transfer, assign, or delegate your obligations and rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. In people-speak, this means <em>you</em> agree to be bound by these Terms. However, we may delegate, assign, or transfer our rights and obligations without your consent.</p>

 fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and b) your violation of these Terms.</p>
<h2>How often will these Terms be updated?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly improving our service, so we may need to update these Terms from time to time. We&rsquo;ll put up a notice on our website, email, or SMS you (if you&rsquo;ve opted to let us contact you), to let you know as soon as possible if we make any amendments to these Terms.</p>
<p>If for some reason we can&rsquo;t get hold of you, please note that as a Kalido user, you will still be bound by the new Terms and our Community Guidelines.</p>
<h2>Choice of law</h2>
<p>Should a dispute arise about these Terms, or about something related to these Terms, the dispute will be addressed in London, England, in English, and held in accordance with the London Court of International Arbitration mediation rules.</p>
<p>To keep things clear, use of Kalido, and the acceptance of these Terms constitutes consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, London, or the United Kingdom.</p>
<h2>Enforceability of Terms</h2>
<p>Should any part or parts of these Terms be unenforceable or invalid, only that portion shall be removed or deleted. Removal or deletion of certain portions does not affect any rights or obligation under the rest of these Terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>These Terms, our Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and in-app permissions form the complete contract between you and us, and no other written or oral agreements shall supersede these.</li>
<li>Save for Apple as discussed above, you agree that no other third party is a beneficiary of these Terms.</li>
