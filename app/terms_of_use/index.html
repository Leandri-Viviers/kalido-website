			<p class="main-heading"> Kalido Terms of Use </p>
			<p class="heading"> Effective date: 1 September 2015 </p>
			<p class="text">
				Kalido was built with one person in mind: you. We&#700;re here to help you make meaningful, mutually beneficial work and social relationships. So, to ensure we deliver the best service to you, please review these Terms of Use (we&#700;ll call them the &lsquo;Terms&rsquo; from here on). As a Kalido user, you agree to be bound by the Terms, and by our <a href="../privacy_policy/index.html">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="../copyright_distribution/index.html">Copyright Distribution Policy</a>, and <a href="../guidelines/index.html">Community Guidelines</a> (which we encourage you to read too). If you have any questions, or concerns, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a> and one of our friendly team will get back to you as soon as possible.

						<p class="heading">
				Will Kalido ever change its services?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Our basic service, helping you make great matches, will always remain. However, we&#700;re constantly improving our service, so we&#700;ll be introducing new features in the future. We&#700;ll always give our users notice of any changes to our service, either through our website, email, or SMS (if you&#700;ve opted in to being contacted by us).
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				What fees does Kalido charge?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Kalido&#700;s basic service is free, and always will be. This is because we believe in entrepreneurship and encourage meaningful connections, so we want as many professionals to be able to work on their own terms as possible, and as many clients to be able to find them as possible.<br/><br/>

				We also don&#700;t charge commission, recruiting, or service fees. Payment between you and another user is thus entirely your responsibility.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				How does a user leave Kalido?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				You&#700;re free to leave Kalido at any time, though we&#700;ll be sorry to see you go. You can review our <a href="../privacy_policy/index.html">Privacy Policy</a> to see how we manage your personal information after you&#700;ve deleted your account.<br/><br/>

				We may remove a user at our discretion, if in our opinion the user has violated the law, these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or Community Guidelines. If we do plan to remove a user, we&#700;ll try to let that user know, so they can retrieve the content they&#700;ve stored on their profile, unless this would be impractical, illegal, or harmful to someone else or to us.<br/><br/>

				Please note that any obligations that existed before a user leaves Kalido will continue to exist e.g. if you had to pay us fees, or if someone had to pay you. All parties will be expected to honour these obligations, regardless of a party leaving Kalido.<br/><br/>

				You may not transfer, assign, or delegate your obligations and rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. In people-speak, this means <i>you</i> agree to be bound by these Terms. However, we may delegate, assign, or transfer our rights and obligations without your consent.

				Limitation of liability
			</p>

			<p class="text">

			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				How often will these terms be updated?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				We&#700;re constantly improving our service, so we may need to update these Terms from time to time. We&#700;ll put up a notice on our website, email, or SMS you (if you&#700;ve opted to let us contact you), to let you know as soon as possible if we make any amendments to these Terms.<br/><br/>

				If for some reason we can&#700;t get hold of you, please note that as a Kalido user, you will still be bound by the new Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				Choice of law
			</p>

			<p class="text">

				To keep things clear, use of Kalido, and the acceptance of these Terms constitutes consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California.<br/><br/>
