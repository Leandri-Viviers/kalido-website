						<p class="stronger">How does Kalido work?</p>
						<p class="info">Kalido is a networking and hiring platform that ranks your connections to help you narrow down good matches, instead of haphazardly giving you a bunch of contacts, with no way of filtering them. Kalido ranks matches based on their degree of connectedness to you, and on how relevant they are. The closer they are to you (a friend rather than a friend of a friend) or the more they have in common with you (shared contacts, goals, or location that make it easier for you to work together), the higher they rank. This helps you decide the best person to work with, and encourages safer, more personal and more meaningful connections.<br><br></p>
						
						<p class="stronger">How can I get the most out of Kalido?</p>
						<p class="info">It&#700;s actually pretty easy. All you have to do is:
						Make sure your profile is as complete as possible (give as much information as you&#700;re comfortable sharing, this will help Kalido match you). 
						Add specific goals - lots of them. The more specific your goals are, the more relevant matches Kalido can find.
						Make sure you have a great profile picture (after all, every side is your good side).
						Add lots of pictures. Showcase your fantastic portfolio, or just include action shots of you doing what you&#700;re good at.
						Invite colleagues, friends and family to Kalido to increase your recommendations.<br><br></p>

						 
						<p class="stronger">Is Kalido user-friendly?</p>
						<p class="info">Yup. Our primary goal is to get as many people as possible to use Kalido to develop meaningful connections. That&#700;s why Kalido uses natural language searching and offers convenient notifications, making it easier to find the people you want to work with.<br><br></p>
						 

						<p class="stronger">Can anyone use Kalido?</p>
						<p class="info">Sure, anyone above the age of 13 is welcome. Unfortunately, due to legal constraints, under 13s will have to wait for their 13th birthday to sign up.<br><br></p>


						<p class="stronger">Can I delete my account?</p>
						<p class="info">We&#700;ll be sorry to say goodbye, but we certainly won&#700;t stop you. You can tap SETTINGS on your profile screen and choose DELETE MY ACCOUNT. Unfortunately, deleting your account means all your data, including chat history, matches, goals, pictures and other media will be lost.<br><br></p>
					</div>

					<div id="goals" class="slide" data-anchor="slide2">
						<p class="stronger">What is a goal?</p>
						<p class="info">This is what you hope to achieve from using Kalido. For example, you might want to find a terrific client to give dance lessons to. Or maybe you&#700;re the client, and you want to find a talented dance teacher. Once you&#700;ve told Kalido your goal, you&#700;ll be matched to the best contact fitting the service and your location. You can also search people who have specific job titles, or who have worked at specific companies, although you will only be matched in this case if you have at least one contact in common.<br><br></p>
						 
						<p class="stronger">What sort of goals can I have?</p>
						<p class="info">Although Kalido is primarily aimed at making connections for business purposes, we&#700;re firm believers in work/life balance, so we fully encourage connecting for purely social reasons too. Your goal can be anything from providing or requesting corporate services, to finding a running partner, to simply getting together for a long overdue catch-up. Although we use the terms &#700;professional&#700;, &#700;client&#700; and &#700;service&#700;, all we really mean is &#700;someone who can do something I want&#700;, &#700;someone who wants something I can do&#700; and &#700;something I&#700;m good at doing&#700;.<br><br></p>
						 

						<p class="stronger">Who can see my goals?</p>
						<p class="info">Your Kalido Contacts can see all of your goals on your Profile page. Non-Kalido contacts can only see the goals that have been matched to their own (so that you can choose to work together). If Kalido can&#700;t find a match for a particular goal, this goal will be broadcast to all of your Kalido Contacts to see if they can help you find a potential match. <br><br></p>
						 
						 
						<p class="stronger">What is a Kalido Contact?</p>
						<p class="info">Two users are Kalido Contacts if they both have each other&#700;s respective mobile numbers, are both on Kalido, and have not blocked each other. So, although you&#700;ll be given a bunch of contacts (in decreasing degrees of connectedness and relevance to you), you need to exchange details with someone before they become a Kalido Contact.<br><br></p>
						 

						<p class="stronger">What&#700;s the benefit of adding Kalido Contacts?</p>
						<p class="info">The more Kalido Contacts you have, the more referrals you&#700;ll get, and the easier it will be to match you with potential clients and professionals. As Kalido ranks you based on your degree of connectedness with someone, upgrading a user from a general contact (friend of a friend) to your Kalido Contact will push you up the ranks. To get more Kalido Contacts, invite your colleagues, friends, and family to join Kalido. You&#700;ll be connected to their contacts, which you can then upgrade to become your Kalido Contacts.<br><br></p>

						 
						<p class="stronger">How does matching work?</p>
						<p class="info">Kalido ranks matches based on their degree of connectedness and relevance to you. The closer in degree they are, and the more they have in common with you (like a shared location or goal) the higher they rank. For example, your friend is closer in degree to you, and will rank higher than a friend of a friend. Similarly, someone who lives close by and shares the same goal as you will rank higher than someone who shares the same goal, but is far away. Kalido&#700;s unique ranking of matches helps you make a more educated decision about who you want to work with.<br><br></p>
						 

						<p class="stronger">How specific is Kalido&#700;s matching?</p>
						<p class="info">Very. Your goal and the other person&#700;s goal must match, and you must both be in close proximity to each other. Only if no such contact is found will Kalido suggest other matches whose goals may relate to yours, or who may be located further away.<br><br></p>
						 

						<p class="stronger"> What if I&#700;m not happy with the contact I&#700;m matched with?</p>
						<p class="info">Kalido does not vet or endorse any users, which means that we unfortunately can&#700;t take responsibility for the quality of services rendered. Kalido gives you information that helps you decide whether you want to work with someone. Our unique ranking system guides you towards contacts who are closer in connectedness, or are of more relevance to you, but ultimately, it will be your decision. However, if you&#700;ve fallen victim to fraud or other illegal activities, we will certainly help you block someone, or remove their account from Kalido.<br><br></p>
					</div>

					<div id="privacy" class="slide" data-anchor="slide3">
						<p class="stronger">I worry about stalkers, can I block someone?</p>
						<p class="info">Kalido takes your security very seriously and with our built-in safety features, stalking, other unsavoury, or illegal behaviour should be very rare. We only share your personal information with your Kalido Contacts (people you&#700;ve trusted with your personal details). Only general information about your goals is shared with other Kalido users (to match you and help you decide whether to work together). In addition, you can choose DON&#700;T SHARE MY LOCATION for certain people, or BLOCK them completely from your Contact screen. In the rare event of bad behaviour, please report it to us. We&#700;ll deal with it quite severely.<br><br></p>
						 

						<p class="stronger">Why does Kalido need my location?</p>
						<p class="info">Kalido uses your present location to find you the best matches for your goals. However, for your safety, your location is only ever given as a general estimate, and never closer than 250m. Your Kalido Contacts will see your current country, city or neighbourhood (whichever is most relevant based on where they are), while other users will only see relative distance from themselves.<br><br></p>

						 
						<p class="stronger">How secure is Kalido?</p>
						<p class="info">Very. All information you give Kalido is secured on your device and our servers using AES-256 and SHA2; while in transit using SSL; and on a call using SRTP. Kalido will also never transmit your exact location, so no one can reverse engineer this on their phones.<br><br></p>
						 

						<p class="stronger">Are you going to sell my information to advertisers?</p>
						<p class="info">No way. We won&#700;t share personally identifiable information with any third parties without your express permission.<br><br></p>
					</div>

					<div id="calls" class="slide" data-anchor="slide4">
						<p class="stronger">Who can I call?</p>
						<p class="info">Only Kalido Contacts can be called through the app. To call someone you don&#700;t know, you must first add each other as Kalido Contacts by exchanging names and numbers and saving each other&#700;s respective details in your Phonebook.<br><br></p>
						 
						<p class="stronger">Why do I have a monthly call limit?</p>
						<p class="info">We&#700;d love to give you unlimited calls, but as a startup, this just isn&#700;t viable. We think giving all our users 60 minutes of free calls a month for their Kalido Contacts is a pretty good start though.<br><br></p>
					</div>

					<div id="payment" class="slide" data-anchor="slide5">
						<p class="stronger">Do I have to pay for Kalido?</p>
						<p class="info">Nope. Kalido is free for download and always will be. We believe in entrepreneurship and encourage meaningful connections, so we want as many talented professionals to be able to work on their own terms as possible, and as many terrific clients to be able to find them as possible. At some later stage, premium add-ons may be charged for, but currently, the only charges will be on data from your network provider. <br><br></p>

						<p class="stronger">Can I pay someone on Kalido?</p>
						<p class="info">At the moment, you&#700;ll both agree on payment outside of the app. However, we&#700;re working hard on a super secure system that will allow you to make payments from Kalido in the future.<br><br></p>
					</div>

					<div id="other"class="slide" data-anchor="slide6">
						<p class="stronger">What is an ice-breaker?</p>
						<p class="info">These are default opening lines that let you introduce yourself to someone you don&#700;t know.
						They are designed to help you start the conversation with someone you are interested in working with.<br><br></p>

						<p class="stronger">What is a karma card?</p>
						<p class="info">This is a notification that one of your Kalido Contacts is looking for a match, which you can suggest to them. For example, if your friend is looking for someone to teach their granny bongos, and you happen to know your neighbour fits the bill, you can use Kalido to put them in contact with each other.<br><br> </p>
						 
						<p class="stronger">I have another question, is there a real human being I can speak to?</p>
						<p class="info">Of course. We&#700;d love to hear from you. You can find us here.<br><br></p>
