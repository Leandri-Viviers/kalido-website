			This is what you want to achieve on Kalido. For example, you might want to find a client to give dance lessons to. Or maybe you&#700;re the client, and you want to find a talented dance teacher. Once you&#700;ve told Kalido your goal, you&#700;ll be matched to the person that can best help you achieve it. You can also search people who have specific job titles, or who have worked at specific companies, although you will only be matched in this case if you have at least one contact in common.

			Just tap your profile picture on the top right, and select &lsquo;Add a Provide Goal&rsquo; (for services you can provide) or &lsquo;Add a Meet Goal&rsquo; (to find someone you want to meet).

			Although Kalido is primarily aimed at making connections for business purposes, we&#700;re firm believers in work/life balance, so we fully encourage connecting for purely social reasons too. Your goal can be anything from providing or requesting corporate services, to finding a running partner, to simply getting together for a long overdue catch-up. Although we use the terms &lsquo;professional&rsquo;, &lsquo;client&#700; and &lsquo;service&rsquo;, all we really mean is &lsquo;someone who can do something I want&rsquo;, &lsquo;someone who wants something I can do&rsquo; and &lsquo;something I&#700;m good at doing&rsquo;.

			The bubbles are just helpful suggestions, based on what other Kalido users have added. You can add your own unique goals, and sometimes we&#700;ll add these to the bubbles for future users too.

			<p> How should I phrase my goal? </p>
		</a>

		<p>
			Just phrase it as you would normally speak. Because Kalido uses natural language searching, it doesn&#700;t matter if you say you can provide yoga &lsquo;lessons&rsquo;, or yoga &lsquo;classes&rsquo;. Kalido will intelligently match you to the right client. The only important thing to remember is that your goals should be able to complete the default phrases of &lsquo;I can provide&rsquo; (for your Provide Goals) and &lsquo;I want to meet&rsquo; (for your Meet Goals).

			Your Kalido Contacts can see all your goals, while matched contacts will only see the goal they&#700;ve been matched to. If Kalido can&#700;t find a match for a particular goal, this goal will be broadcast to all of your Kalido Contacts to see if they can help you find a potential match.

	<div class="faq-answer open">
		<p>
			In the unlikely event that Kalido can&#700;t find a match for you, your goal will be broadcast to all your Kalido Contacts, to see if they can recommend someone who fits your goal. Also, new people are always signing up to Kalido, so sometimes a little time is all it takes.
