			Kalido uses your phonebook to generate matches for you. Matching with someone you already know generates a more trustworthy connection than someone you don&#700;t. It also lets you invite any of your contacts to join Kalido easily and conveniently. Remember, you can only send text and images to your general contacts from Kalido, but once you&#700;ve added them as Kalido Contacts, you&#700;ll be able to call them too (for 60 minutes each month, to each Kalido Contact, for free)!

			Kalido takes your security very seriously and with our built-in safety features, stalking, other unsavoury, or illegal behaviour should be very rare. We only share your personal information with your Kalido Contacts (people you&#700;ve trusted with your personal details). Only general information about your goals is shared with other Kalido users (to match you and help you decide whether to work together). In addition, you can choose to stop sharing your location with a specific person. Just go to your Nearby screen, tap on the user, and opt to stop sharing your location with them. This person will never match with you again. In the event of bad behaviour please report it to us. We&#700;ll deal with it quite severely.

		<p>
			Kalido uses your present location to find you the best matches for your goals. However, for your safety, your location is only ever given as a general estimate, and never closer than 250m. Your Kalido Contacts will see your current country, city, or neighbourhood (whichever is most relevant based on where they are), while other users will only see relative distance from themselves.

			By default, your Kalido Contacts will see your current country, city, or neighbourhood (whichever is most relevant based on where they are), while other users will see relative distance from themselves. For your safety, your location is only ever given as a general estimate, and never closer than 250m. You can block a specific person from seeing your location, and you can also stop sharing your location completely. Unfortunately, Kalido won&#700;t work at its best if you do the latter though, as we won&#700;t be able to tell how close your matches are to you.

			Kalido picks up your current location to find great matches wherever you are <i>now</i>. This means you&#700;ll find great matches that you can meet and work with, wherever in the world you may be. We don&#700;t allow you to manually set a location to match on, but we may introduce a feature that allows you to do this in the future, so that you can continue to match with people at your permanent location, even while you&#700;re on your week getaway.

			<p> How secure is Kalido? </p>
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-answer open">
		<p>
			Very. All information you give Kalido is secured on your device and our servers using transparent database encryption, AES-256 and SHA2; while in transit using SSL; and on a call using SRTP. Kalido will also never transmit your exact location, so no one can reverse engineer this on their phones.
