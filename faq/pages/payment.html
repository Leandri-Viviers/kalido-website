			Nope. Kalido is free for download and always will be. We believe in entrepreneurship and encourage meaningful connections, so we want as many professionals to be able to work on their own terms as possible, and as many clients to be able to find them as possible. At some later stage, premium add-ons may be charged for, but currently, the only charges will be on data from your network provider.

			Sadly not. That&#700;s why we try to match you with someone you already have a trust-based connection with (common contacts, networks etc.), so you&#700;re less likely to meet up with someone who gives you trouble with payments. Please report unscrupulous users to us at <a class="faq-mailto" href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a>, because although we won&#700;t be able to enforce payment from them, we&#700;ll at least be able to remove them from Kalido.

			The legal answer is: You&#700;ll have agreed to the terms of your arrangement when the work started, and any disputes will be governed by the laws of your country, or the international laws of contract and sale. The &lsquo;people&rsquo; answer is: Talk to your service provider, you&#700;ll probably be able to come to some sort of agreement that you&#700;ll both be ok with.

			At the moment, we don&#700;t. In the future, we will be introducing amazing new services that we think will be so valuable that you&#700;ll be excited to pay for them. Posting goals and matching within Kalido will remain free though: we are deeply committed to empowering entrepreneurs, freelancers and small businesses.
