			A match is someone Kalido has found that fits your goal. So, it&#700;s the great guitar teacher you&#700;ve been looking for. Or, if you&#700;re the guitar teacher, it&#700;s the dream client you&#700;ve been wanting to meet.

			<p> How does matching work? </p>
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-answer open">
		<p>
			Kalido ranks matches based on how relevant, and socially and physically close they are to you. So, someone who lives close by (physically close) and shares the same goal as you (relevant) will rank higher than someone who shares the same goal, but is far away. And your friend, who is socially closer to you, will rank higher than a friend of a friend. Kalido&#700;s personalized ranking of matches helps you make a more educated decision about the best person to work with.

			<p> How specific is Kalido&#700;s matching? </p>
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-answer open">
		<p>
			Very. Your goal and the other person&#700;s goal must match. Only if Kalido can&#700;t find someone whose goal matches yours exactly, will users with related goals be suggested. Additionally, your matches are ranked for physical proximity, with people closest to you ranking higher, making it easier for you to meet up and work together.

	<div class="faq-answer open">
		<p>
			That&#700;s what Kalido is here for! You can help by making your goals as specific as possible (don&#700;t just tell us you&#700;re looking for an &lsquo;accountant&rsquo;, tell us you want a &lsquo;forensic accountant who lives in Chicago&rsquo;); making your profile as complete as possible (add a profile picture, media, and interests etc.); and inviting as many people as possible to join Kalido (so we can match you to their extended networks too).

			Kalido will match you to someone who has a complementary goal to yours. So, your Provide Goal of &lsquo;I can give yoga lessons&rsquo; will be matched to your client&#700;s Meet Goal of &lsquo;I want to meet a yoga teacher&rsquo;. Because Kalido offers natural language searching, it doesn&#700;t matter what phrase you use (&lsquo;yoga teacher&rsquo; or &lsquo;yoga lessons&rsquo;), the system will intelligently match you.

			Kalido does not vet or endorse any users, which means that, unfortunately, we can&#700;t take responsibility for the quality of services rendered. Kalido gives you information that helps <i>you</i> decide whether you want to work with someone. Our personalized ranking system guides you towards contacts who are more relevant, and socially and physically closer to you, but ultimately, it will be your decision. However, if you&#700;ve fallen victim to fraud or other illegal activities, please let us know, and we will certainly help you block someone, or remove their account from Kalido.

			Yes. For example, you can specify &lsquo;I want to meet someone from Great Yoga Teachers International&rsquo; as a Meet Goal. However, you&#700;ll only be matched to someone from this network if you have something in common with them (a shared contact or network), and if they&#700;ve opted in to be matched by network.

			Occasionally, Kalido will match you to someone who has a common network or common contacts with you, if your networks match one of <i>their</i> goals. For example, if you&#700;re part of Great Yoga Teachers International, and a user tells us &lsquo;I want to meet someone from Great Yoga Teachers International&rsquo;, you&#700;ll be suggested to them as a match (but only if they have some trust-based connection to you i.e. a common contact or common network). If you don&#700;t find this feature helpful or necessary, you can always tap on the 3 vertical dots on the top right of your Match Card and select &lsquo;Don&#700;t match with this person again&rsquo; or &lsquo;This is a poor match&rsquo;.
