			<p class="main-heading">Kalido Privacy Policy </p>
			<p class="heading">Effective date: 1 September 2015</p>

			<p class="text">
				Here at Om Mobile Ventures (known to the world as &lsquo;Kalido&rsquo;), we&#700;re all about meaningful, mutually beneficial, and transparent relationships. That&#700;s why we have this, our Privacy Policy (we&#700;ll call it &lsquo;the Policy&rsquo; from here on). It lays out exactly how we protect, and help you protect, yourself and your data as a Kalido user. We&#700;ve tried to make it as people-friendly as possible, but if you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="heading">Who is this Policy for?</p>

			<p class="text">
				You. As a Kalido user, you&#700;ll be protected and bound by this Policy. It sets out exactly how we collect, use, and share any information that you give us. This Policy forms part of our <a href="terms_of_use.html">Terms of Use</a> that govern your relationship with us (which we encourage you to read too). Please note that by registering on Kalido, you will automatically be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, this Policy, and consented to its terms.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">What does this Policy cover?</p>

			<p class="text">
				All your personally identifiable information (let&#700;s call this your &lsquo;personal info&rsquo; for short) is protected under this Policy. So, all the personal info that you share with us is protected. However, the Policy does not stretch to the practices of companies or individuals that we don&#700;t control, for example, third party partners.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">Why is this Policy necessary?</p>

			<p class="text">
				To make the most of your Kalido experience, we have to collect certain personal info from you. For example, giving us your name and work experience helps us find clients for you that match your expertise. Sharing your location with us means we&#700;ll be able to find you nearby matches, so it&#700;s easier for you to work together. And letting us access your contacts means you&#700;ll be matching through your own trusted networks. So, the personal info we collect is really all about helping you make the best matches. This Policy sets out how and when we collect information from you, as well as how and when we use and share this data.
				<br/><br/>

				In order to protect minors, we don&#700;t allow users under the age of 13 on Kalido. So, we also don&#700;t knowingly solicit or collect personal info from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please don&#700;t register. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal info on a minor, we will delete this data as soon as possible. If you believe that a minor&#700;s personal info has somehow been shared with us, please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a>. We&#700;ll deal with the issue immediately.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">What personal info does Kalido collect?</p>

			<p class="text">
				There are 3 different categories of information that we collect through your use of Kalido:<br/><br/>

				<span class="sub_heading">i. Info that you provide us with</span><br/><br/>
				This is information that you&#700;ve given us at sign up, or later. This usually includes your name, work history, contacts, networks, and some third party account information (like your linked Facebook account). You can choose what information you share with us, and you can always change your in-app settings at any time.<br/><br/>

				We&#700;ll also ask for permission to contact you, via push notifications, emails, or SMS. This lets you stay up to date with what&#700;s happening on Kalido and on your matches easily and conveniently. You can also opt out of any of these communications e.g. by changing your in-app settings, or following the Unsubscribe link on emails.<br/><br/>

				<span class="sub_heading">ii. Info collected automatically</span><br/><br/>
				Every time you interact with Kalido, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device. This info includes your IP address, geolocation data, device and browser identification, and cookie information. This happens automatically, though you can make certain changes on how you share this type of info from your device or browser. The reason we collect this sort of data is to customize your Kalido experience, to make it more interesting and relevant to you. For example, if we see that many of our users regularly use one feature as opposed to another, we&#700;ll concentrate on improving the former, to improve our users&#700; experience.<br/><br/>

				<span class="sub_heading">iii. Info collected from other websites</span><br/><br/>
				Through cookies that we&#700;ve collected, we receive certain information about your online activities after you leave Kalido. We currently don&#700;t support a Do Not Track system on Kalido, but your browser may offer you this option, which tells websites, applications, and services that you don&#700;t want to share this information.<br/><br/>

				We may also have advertising partners who&#700;ll transmit cookies to you, or you might get cookies from third party sites that you&#700;ve jumped to through Kalido. This Policy does not govern those situations. Your interaction with third parties will be governed by their respective policies and practices.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">What does Kalido do with this personal info?</p>

			<p class="text">
				Firstly, we&#700;ll never rent or sell your personal info, in personally identifiable form, to anyone. Personal info that you share is only used to improve your user experience. For example, sharing your work history means we&#700;ll be able to match you with someone in your network, who is more likely to share your work ethos. So, the more information you give us about yourself, the more we can match you with people who have things in common with you.<br/><br/>

				We employ other companies and people to perform services for you on our behalf (these are our agents). For example, we may use a payment processing company to manage your credit card transactions, allowing you to make and receive payments conveniently from Kalido. Our agents will only have access to the information necessary for them to perform these services.<br/><br/>

				We may also share info that&#700;s been de-identified (in other words, your info is no longer identifiable as yours) in an aggregated form with our partners. This anonymous, collective information helps our partners understand how our users are using Kalido, so they in turn can provide you (and all our other users) with a better service. For example, affiliated businesses or advertisers will be able to show you relevant services that help you achieve your goals, as opposed to random messaging that doesn&#700;t interest you. We&#700;ll only share data with these affiliated businesses to the extent needed for them to service you. Please note that your interactions with these affiliated businesses will be governed by their respective policies and practices, and Kalido does not accept any responsibility or liability for their products or services.<br/><br/>

				In the future, we may choose to buy or sell assets to improve or expand our business. There is also the (unlikely) possibility that we are bought out or liquidated. If any of these scenarios occur, personal info may be transferred to a third party. We&#700;ll of course let you know as soon as possible if this is ever the case.<br/><br/>

				Finally, as law abiding citizens, we have the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information we believe is necessary to comply with the law, or a court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights or safety of our company, our employees, our users, or others.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">How safe is your personal info?</p>

			<p class="text">
				You should only ever let trusted individuals have access to your devices, browsers, and apps. This is a basic safety tip that relates to all your online experiences.<br/><br/>

				Once your personal info gets to us, everything is secured on your device and our servers using AES-256 and SHA2; while in transit using SSL; and on a call using SRTP. We will also never transmit your exact location, so no one can reverse engineer this on their phones. Basically, your info is very safe. However, as with all apps, unauthorized entry or usage, unforeseen hardware or software failure, or other factors which cannot be reasonably foreseen, may compromise the safety of the information.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">How can you access your personal info?</p>

			<p class="text">
				You can access your personal info, including your basic information, images, and chats through your profile. You can edit and delete your information from your in-app settings. You can also delete your entire profile if you wish. We&#700;ll be sorry to see you go, but we&#700;ll delete your personal info as requested. However, we might still retain de-identified info (in other words, information that can&#700;t be linked to you as an individual) in an anonymous, aggregated form to improve our service.<br/><br/>

				Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, residents of California can ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal info which we share with third parties for marketing purposes, and the contact information for these third parties. If you&#700;re a California resident who would like this notice, please mail us at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a>.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">How often will we update this policy?</p>

			<p class="text">
				We&#700;re constantly improving our service, so we may need to update this Policy from time to time. We&#700;ll put up a notice on our website, email, or SMS you (if you&#700;ve opted to let us contact you), to let you know as soon as possible, if we make any amendments to this Policy. Any information we collect is governed by the Policy in place when the information is used.<br/><br/>

				If for some reason we can&#700;t get hold of you (for example, if you&#700;ve opted out of receiving emails from us), please note that as a Kalido user, you will still be bound by the new Policy, and of course, our Terms of Use, and Community Guidelines.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">If a user has any questions or concerns, how can a real human being be contacted?</p>

			<p class="text">
				Our team is always available at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a>. We might need a few business days to get back to you, but we <i>will</i> do so as soon as possible.
