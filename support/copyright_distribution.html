				It shouldn&#700;t really have to be said, but stealing is not ok. As a community based on trust, respect, and meaningful human relationships, we want all our users to be able to showcase their creativity and talent without worrying that their stuff is going to be ripped off. To this end, we&#700;ve drafted this Copyright Distribution Policy (we&#700;ll call it the &lsquo;Copyright Policy&rsquo; from now) which governs copyright infringement and alleged infringements on Kalido. This Copyright Policy forms part of our Terms of Use.
