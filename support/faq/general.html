		<p>
			Kalido ranks your connections, to help you narrow down good matches, instead of haphazardly giving you a list of names, with no useful way of filtering them. Kalido ranks matches based on how close they are to you socially and physically, and on how relevant they are. The closer they are to you socially (a friend rather than a friend of a friend) or the more they have in common with you (shared goals, location, or networks), the higher they rank. This helps you decide the best person to work with, and encourages safer, more personal, and more meaningful connections.

			<p> How can I get the most out of Kalido? </p>
		</a>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-answer open">
		<p>
			It&#700;s actually pretty easy. All you have to do is:
		</p>
		<ul class="faq-list">
			<li> Make sure your profile is as complete as possible (give as much information as you&#700;re comfortable sharing, this will help Kalido match you). </li>
			<li> Add specific goals - lots of them. The more specific your goals are, the more relevant matches Kalido can find. </li>
			<li> Invite colleagues, friends, and family to Kalido, to get more and better matches. </li>
			<li> Make sure you have a great profile picture (after all, every side is your good side). </li>
			<li> Add lots of pics. Showcase your fantastic portfolio, or just include action shots of you doing what you&#700;re good at. </li>

			Yup. Our primary goal is to get as many people as possible to use Kalido to develop meaningful connections. That&#700;s why Kalido offers natural language searching and convenient notifications, making it easier to find the people you want to work with.

			Sure, anyone above the age of 13 is welcome. Unfortunately, due to legal constraints, young ones will have to wait for their 13<sup>th</sup> birthday to sign up.
