			Only Kalido Contacts can be called through the app. To call someone you don&#700;t know, you must first add each other as Kalido Contacts, by exchanging names and numbers (or emails), and saving each other&#700;s respective details in your phonebook.

			We&#700;d love to give you unlimited calls, but as a startup, this just isn&#700;t viable. We think giving all our users 60 minutes of free calls a month for their Kalido Contacts is a pretty good start though.
