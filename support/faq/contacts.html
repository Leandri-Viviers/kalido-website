			Two users are Kalido Contacts if they are both on Kalido, have each other&#700;s respective mobile numbers, and have not blocked each other. So, although you&#700;ll match with a range of people (in decreasing degrees of relevance, and social and physical closeness to you), you need to exchange details with someone before they become a Kalido Contact.

			<p> What&#700;s the benefit of adding Kalido Contacts? </p>

			The more Kalido Contacts you have, the more referrals you&#700;ll get, and the easier it will be to match you with potential clients and professionals. As Kalido ranks you based on your social closeness with someone, upgrading a user from a general contact (friend of a friend) to your Kalido Contact (friend) will push you up the ranks. To get more Kalido Contacts, invite your colleagues, friends, and family to join. You&#700;ll be connected to their contacts, which you can then upgrade to become <i>your</i> Kalido Contacts.

			<p> Can I introduce people to each other if they&#700;re not on Kalido? </p>

		<p>
			Yup. As long as a contact is in your phonebook, even if this person hasn&#700;t joined Kalido yet, you can make an introduction.

			Kalido makes it easy to check someone out:
		</p>
		<ul class="faq-list">
			<li> You can ask your common contacts for referrals, so you have an idea of their personality and reputation before meeting up. </li>
			<li> Since you&#700;ll likely be physically close to each other, you can always arrange for a face-to-face meet up before choosing to work with them. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Kalido doesn&#700;t vet or endorse any users, but we feel that letting you access someone&#700;s shared contacts and networks gives you a better chance of assessing their qualities than relying on ratings or reviews from strangers.
