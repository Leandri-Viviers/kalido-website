			<p class="main-heading"> Kalido Terms of Use </p>
			<p class="heading"> Effective date: 1 September 2015 </p>

			<p class="text">
				Kalido was built with one person in mind: you. We&#700;re here to help you make meaningful, mutually beneficial work and social relationships. So, to ensure we deliver the best service to you, please review these Terms of Use (we&#700;ll call them the &lsquo;Terms&rsquo; from here on). As a Kalido user, you agree to be bound by the Terms, and by our <a href="privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="copyright_distribution.html">Copyright Distribution Policy</a>, and <a href="community_guidelines.html">Community Guidelines</a> (which we encourage you to read too). If you have any questions, or concerns, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a> and one of our friendly team will get back to you as soon as possible.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				Terms and conditions applicable to all Kalido users
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				i. By registering on Kalido, you&#700;ll automatically be deemed to have accepted and agreed to be bound by these Terms, by our Privacy Policy, and Community Guidelines. All these documents constitute legal contracts, so you need to be a legal person with the capacity to enter into agreements. If you&#700;re a minor, you&#700;ll need your legal guardian to agree on your behalf. If you&#700;re acting on behalf of a company, you need to be legally entitled to do so. Please note that we do not accept users under the age of 13 under any circumstances.<br/><br/>

				ii. Kalido helps you build professional and personal relationships. In order to make these genuine and meaningful, you should provide as much detail about yourself as you&#700;re comfortable sharing. Don&#700;t use a fake name, give false credentials, or pass someone else&#700;s work off as your own. After all, Kalido is about showcasing <i>you</i>.<br/><br/>

				iii. We&#700;re all law-abiding citizens here, so you agree not to use Kalido to break any laws, or act in a generally unpleasant way. &lsquo;Unlawfulness&rsquo; and &lsquo;unpleasantness&rsquo; include, but are not limited to: 
			</p>

			<ul class="list">
				<li>
					Copyright, contract, intellectual property, and all other applicable local and international laws;
				</li>
				<li>
					Behaviour that jeopardizes your, or any other user&#700;s, or Kalido&#700;s safety. For example, you shouldn&#700;t allow anyone else to log in to your personal profile (this could harm you). You also shouldn&#700;t use anyone else&#700;s work without their permission (this harms them). Nor should you post hateful or offensive content (this harms us);
				</li>
				<li>
					Harassment, intimidation, fraudulent or obscene behaviour;
				</li>
				<li>
					Installing malware, spiders, hacking programmes, or any other activities that attempt to steal or corrupt our service and intellectual property, or that of our users.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="text">
				We&#700;re very serious about keeping our community one based on respect, trust, and meaningful human connections. Therefore, if any user&#700;s behaviour violates or corrupts the spirit of our community, we reserve the right to remove this user with immediate effect.<br/><br/>

				iv. As with all other online forums, you should protect your account and personal information as much as you reasonably can. In return, we have implemented strict security measures to protect you and your information too. You can find out more about how we protect your information from our Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>

				v. As a Kalido user, you&#700;ll be giving us and other users access to your personal information. You&#700;ll also be given access to others&#700; personal information. We expect all our users to be respectful of each other.<br/><br/>

				vi. We will store and share your personal information in as far as it&#700;s necessary to help you make the most of Kalido. For example, we might allow other users to see your name and location, to help them decide whether you&#700;re a good match. Remember, you can tailor the audience of any information you share (e.g. by only allowing certain users to see your location), and you can always change your preferences from your in-app settings. You can also opt out of sharing information. We will always respect your privacy and sharing preferences.<br/><br/>

				vii. By sharing content with us (this is called your &lsquo;user submissions&rsquo; in legal jargon), you are granting us a license over your content. And for further legal jargon, please note that this license is royalty-free, sub-licenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your account, we will stop displaying your content as per our Privacy Policy.<br/><br/>

				We will always respect the audience you&#700;ve chosen for your personal information. For example, you can choose to have information on your profile viewable only by you, only by certain contacts, or by the public. The licenses that you grant us mean we will only display, perform, or distribute your information to the respective audience you&#700;ve chosen.<br/><br/>

				However, please note that if some of your content has been copied or stored by third parties e.g. if one of your matches took a screenshot of your profile, we don&#700;t have control over that.<br/><br/>

				viii. In order to properly showcase your content on Kalido, we might have to make changes to your user submissions occasionally e.g. by cropping your picture to fit within the profile frame. Please note that all your content is protected by all applicable local and international law.<br/><br/>

				ix. We&#700;re a platform that helps you connect with other human beings. As such, we offer services like letting you share pictures, chat directly to contacts, and ask mutual contacts for referrals and introductions. All this is designed to help <i>you</i> decide who the best person to work and hang out with is.<br/><br/>

				We don&#700;t vet or endorse any users, nor are we responsible for any user&#700;s content or claims. However, as stated above, we expect all our users to treat each other with respect, so if you encounter any fraudulent or unlawful behaviour, please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@kalido.me">support@kalido.me</a>, and we&#700;ll deal with the offender immediately. We reserve the right to remove any user that violates the law, the Terms, our Privacy Policy, and/or our Community Guidelines. We also reserve the right to remove content (including content belonging to you), if it violates any of the above.<br/><br/>

				x. We provide you, our users, with a platform to interact with other users. However, we aren&#700;t responsible for your actual interactions. For example, we won&#700;t be able to help you enforce payment from someone, or draw up a contract. We encourage all our users to do their own checks, through the services we offer e.g. by asking mutual contacts for referrals. You agree that Kalido shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.<br/><br/>

				xi. As we are simply a platform that provides you with a space to interact with others, in the event of a dispute, whether between you and another user, or between you and a third party, we&#700;re not under any legal obligation to get involved. However, as we want our users to have a positive experience, we&#700;ll probably endeavor to help you where we can.<br/><br/>

				xii. You agree to indemnify us, our officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and successors from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from any disputes between you and another user, or third party.<br/><br/>

				xiii. Please note that you&#700;ll be responsible for any tax, legal, or payment obligations that arise out of your use of Kalido e.g. you still have to pay income tax to the relevant authorities. We won&#700;t help you escape your legal obligations.<br/><br/>

				xiv. Kalido, its services and all its content, are offered to you on an &lsquo;as is&rsquo; basis, without being subject to any warranty.<br/><br/>

				xv. Kalido is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, private, personal, and non-commercial basis, subject to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and the law. This means you are our user, and are not affiliated with us, or represent us in any way.<br/><br/>

				xvi. While interacting with Kalido, you might come across third party content (for example, we might allow advertising partners to place content on our platform in the future). You might also jump to third party websites from Kalido. Please note that we are not responsible for the content, actions, omissions, or representations of third parties.<br/><br/>

				xvii. If either you or we fail to exercise in any way any right in these Terms, this shall not be deemed as a waiver of any further rights.<br/><br/>
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				Will Kalido ever change its services?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Our basic service, helping you make great matches, will always remain. However, we&#700;re constantly improving our service, so we&#700;ll be introducing new features in the future. We&#700;ll always give our users notice of any changes to our service, either through our website, email, or SMS (if you&#700;ve opted in to being contacted by us).
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				What fees does Kalido charge?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Kalido&#700;s basic service is free, and always will be. This is because we believe in entrepreneurship and encourage meaningful connections, so we want as many professionals to be able to work on their own terms as possible, and as many clients to be able to find them as possible.<br/><br/>

				We also don&#700;t charge commission, recruiting, or service fees. Payment between you and another user is thus entirely your responsibility.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				How does a user leave Kalido?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				You&#700;re free to leave Kalido at any time, though we&#700;ll be sorry to see you go. You can review our <a href="privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to see how we manage your personal information after you&#700;ve deleted your account.<br/><br/>

				We may remove a user at our discretion, if in our opinion the user has violated the law, these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or Community Guidelines. If we do plan to remove a user, we&#700;ll try to let that user know, so they can retrieve the content they&#700;ve stored on their profile, unless this would be impractical, illegal, or harmful to someone else or to us.<br/><br/>

				Please note that any obligations that existed before a user leaves Kalido will continue to exist e.g. if you had to pay us fees, or if someone had to pay you. All parties will be expected to honour these obligations, regardless of a party leaving Kalido.<br/><br/>

				You may not transfer, assign, or delegate your obligations and rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. In people-speak, this means <i>you</i> agree to be bound by these Terms. However, we may delegate, assign, or transfer our rights and obligations without your consent.

				Important info for Apple users
			</p>

			<p class="text">

				</li>

					Apple has no obligation to furnish maintenance or support of Kalido. So, in the event of Kalido failing for whatever reason on an Apple device, Apple will only be liable to you for the refund of the price of the app, if there is a purchase price;
				</li>
				<li>
					In the event of a dispute between you and a third party, Apple is under no obligation to get involved. We may, but are not obligated to, assist you in such dispute. Our involvement is subject to xi and xii above under Terms and Conditions Applicable to All Kalido Users;

				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="heading">
				Limitation of liability
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				What follows are some lengthy clauses drafted by our legal department which basically say: We provide a service to you in good faith, but cannot be held responsible for the consequences of your usage. Here&#700;s what they look like in strict legal terms:<br/><br/>
		
				i. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, under no circumstances and under no legal theory (including, without limitation, tort, contract, strict liability, or otherwise) shall Kalido (or its licensors or suppliers) be liable to you or to any other person for A) any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind, including damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, accuracy of results, or computer failure or malfunction, or B) any amount, in the aggregate, in excess of the greater of i) $100 or ii) the amounts paid by you to the company in connection with the services in the twelve (12) month period preceding this applicable claim, or iii) any matter beyond our reasonable control;<br/><br/>

				ii. Warranty Disclaimer: Neither Kalido nor its licensors or suppliers makes any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services. We (and our licensors and suppliers) make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the Services. Products and services purchased or offered (whether or not following such recommendations and suggestions) through the Services are provided &lsquo;as is&rsquo; and without any warranty of any kind from Kalido or others (unless, with respect to such others only, provided expressly and unambiguously in writing by a designated third party for a specific product);<br/><br/>

				iii. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Kalido, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneysʼ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				How often will these terms be updated?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				We&#700;re constantly improving our service, so we may need to update these Terms from time to time. We&#700;ll put up a notice on our website, email, or SMS you (if you&#700;ve opted to let us contact you), to let you know as soon as possible if we make any amendments to these Terms.<br/><br/>

				If for some reason we can&#700;t get hold of you, please note that as a Kalido user, you will still be bound by the new Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines.
			</p>

			<p class="heading">
				Choice of law
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Should a dispute arise about these Terms, or about something related to these Terms, the dispute will be addressed in San Francisco County, California, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&lsquo;JAMS&rsquo;).<br/><br/>

				To keep things clear, use of Kalido, and the acceptance of these Terms constitutes consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California.<br/><br/>
			</p>

			<p class="heading">Enforceability of terms</p>
			

			<ul class="list">
				<li>
					Should any part or parts of these Terms be unenforceable or invalid, only that portion shall be removed or deleted. Removal or deletion of certain portions does not affect any rights or obligation under the rest of these Terms.
				</li>
				<li>
					These Terms, our Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and in app permissions form the complete contract between you and us, and no other written or oral agreements shall supersede these.
				</li>
